Make sure that you know how to host a dedicated server and run it. 

Your computer must be modern enough or low performance and potential crashes/network degradation for players are inevitable.

1. Place "addons" folder that you see into Left 4 Dead 2 Dedicated Server/left4dead2. 

If it already exists, do it regardless or place the existing folders within "addons" folder into the addons folder, but make sure that it doesn't have any files that would potentially conflict with the mods. 

Both ways will place the proper files into "addons" automatically.

2. Place the "cfg" folder that you see into Left 4 Dead 2 Dedicated Server/left4dead2/cfg. 

If you never touched any config files that it asks you to replace and have no idea what they do despite knowing how to host a server, then do press the confirmation and replace any existing files. 

If you have your own server.cfg set up, then make sure the rates are adjusted accordingly to the tickrate 67 and that certain values within that cfg file are transfered into your own server.cfg. Higher tickrates cause severe gameplay issues.

If you had a sourcemod folder before and had certain mods installed that created the config files for said mods, then replace the configuration with appropriate files either way, as this configuration is vital for this balance.

Final note: If you don't know what you are doing, but had some mods installed for your server, remove them. They are likely to conflict with what has been done here, as there were deep-rooted reasons behind every single change.
